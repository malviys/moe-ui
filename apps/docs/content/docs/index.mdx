description: Build your universal component library with Moe UI.

> This is not a component library. It is how you build your component library.

## Bringing the shadcn/ui experience to React Native

Built with familiar tools and libraries, it follows consistent styling, structure, and naming conventions, letting you use your favorite design system to create beautiful universal apps.

## Key differences from shadcn/ui

- **NativeWind**: Moe UI provides a Tailwind-like experience adapted for React Native using NativeWind.

- **RN Primitives**: A universal port of Radix UI primitives for React Native with an almost identical API, enabling consistent composition on native platforms.

- **Portals**: React Native doesn't support DOM portals. On native platforms, components like modals and menus need a `PortalHost`.

- **No cascading styles**: Child elements like `Text` can't inherit styles from a parent class. Each element must be styled directly.

- **No data attributes**: React Native doesn't support `data-*` attributes, so variants rely on props or state for native platforms.

- **Reanimated**: Uses `react-native-reanimated` for smooth, native performance.

- **Icons**: Uses a wrapper component in combination with Lucide icons to avoid wrapping every imported icon individually.

- **Programmatic control**: Some components, such as `DropdownMenu`, can't be controlled with `open` or `onOpenChange` props. Instead, you use a `ref` to manage open and close behavior.

Moe UI aims to stay true to the spirit of shadcn/ui while adapting it to the unique constraints of mobile/universal development.
