> This is not a component library. It is how you build your component library.

Moe UI brings the **shadcn/ui** experience to React Native. It provides a set of beautifully crafted, accessible, and customizable components that work universally across iOS, Android, and Web.

## Philosophy

Moe UI is built on three core pillars to ensure a top-tier developer and user experience:

### 📱 Universal

Write once, run everywhere. Every component is designed to work seamlessly on **iOS**, **Android**, and the **Web** using a single codebase. By leveraging universal primitives, you can ensure consistent behavior and styling across all platforms.

### ♿ Accessible

Accessibility is a first-class citizen. Built on top of **rn-primitives** (a port of Radix UI), Moe UI ensures that your app is usable by everyone. It handles focus management, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support out of the box.

### 🎨 Customizable

Styled with **NativeWind** (TailwindCSS for React Native), Moe UI gives you complete control over the look and feel of your app. Whether you need to tweak a color, adjust spacing, or implement a completely new theme, you can do it directly with utility classes.

## Adapting for React Native

While Moe UI aims to replicate the **shadcn/ui** experience, distinct differences exist due to the nature of mobile development:

- **NativeWind**: The styling engine that brings TailwindCSS to React Native.
- **RN Primitives**: The foundation for accessible, unstyled components.
- **Portals**: Native modals and menus require `PortalHost` to render correctly above other content.
- **No Cascading Styles**: React Native styles do not cascade. Text styles must be applied directly to `Text` components.
- **Reanimated**: Used for high-performance, native-driven animations.

Moe UI handles these constraints for you, providing a familiar API that feels like home for React developers.
