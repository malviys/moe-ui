## What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) allows AI coding assistants to directly interact with tools and services. With MCP support, you'll be able to add components to your project using natural language.

## Planned Features

- **Add components** - "Add the Button component to my project"
- **Get documentation** - "How do I use the Dialog component?"
- **Browse components** - "What form components are available?"
